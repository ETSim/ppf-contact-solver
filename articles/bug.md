### BVH Construction

In the supplementary PDF, we mentioned that the BVH is reconstructed every 10 video frames; however, this is not what is implemented in the public code.

In this code, the BVH is continuously updated on the CPU side in the background without blocking the simulation. At the beginning of each step, we check if the BVH construction is finished, and if it is, we update the GPU buffer.

### Hang Example (2024-Dec-22)

On 2024-Dec-22, we encountered a situation where the PCG solver in our "hang" example `hang.ipynb` failed to converge, resulting in a simulation failure.

This issue occurred because the step size was set to `0.01`, which turned to be unreliably large for this setting.
We have now changed it to `0.001`.
This makes the system more diagonally dominant, leading to improved conditioning.

In this particular case, the strain-limiting constraint distance became very tight, which made the condition number challenging for the PCG solver to handle.

Note that despite the failure with a step size of `0.01`, this step size usually succeeds.
This is why we could not notice this issue before making our code public and testing many times.

We understand that this is a limitation: for some large step sizes, our method may fail.
One promising fix is to monitor the PCG, and if it fails, re-do the entire step with a smaller step size.
This option can be enabled by `param.set("enable_retry", True)`, but it is disabled by default.
We confirmed that with this option enabled, a larger step size of `0.1` can be chosen.
